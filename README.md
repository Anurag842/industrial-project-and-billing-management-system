## Project Description

### 1. Problem Description: 
The client uses MS Excel in order to maintain their Project list, developer list, allocation list and the calculations for generating billing invoice. 
However it is not possible for them to share the data in the form of Excel file in multi user environment. Also, there are lot of duplicate works, and chances of mistake.

Other than that, client realized below concerns in the current process:
*	When the Project billing price or allocation are changed they need to update each and every excel file. 
* There are no options to find and print previous saved invoice. 
* Most importantly, there is no security. Anybody can access any report and sensitive data. 
* There were no reports to find out the total bill of a single project volume or summary report. 

Therefore, the client wants a web based application to overcome the entire problem which they are facing currently, and making complete atomization of manual billing system.

### 2. Objective
In order to solve clientâ€™s concerns, we need to create a web application which will allow authorized users do below activities:
* Configure and maintain projects and their cost information.
*	Allocate a developer into a project and enter his/her attendance data for a specific month & year.
*	Calculate billing on individual & project basis.
*	Generate billing report/invoice for a specific month & year and for a project or individual developer.

### 3. Users of the System
*	Admin
*	Data entry operator

### 4. Functional Requirements
>	Static Data

  -	List of Projects  e.g. MRD, X, Y
  -	List of Developers
  -	List of Developer roles e.g. Project Managers, Associate Project Manager, Tech Lead, Sr. Developers and Developers.

*	Browser support for IE and Google Chrome
*	Reports exportable in .XLS

### 6. Tools and Technologies to be used
*	Use any IDE to develop the project. It may be MyEclipse / Eclipse.
*	Use Maven for dependency management.
*	Java (version 1.7 and above).
* Spring MVC
* Oracle SQL for the database.
